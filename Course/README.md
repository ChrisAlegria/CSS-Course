# üé® CSS Course 

## üìñ Course and Project Description  
This repository is composed of two parts:

1. **CSS Course**:  
   In the **`course/`** folder, you will find my personal notes on the basic and practical concepts of CSS that I learned in the **SergieCode** course. This course provides the fundamental knowledge needed to understand and practice CSS, including code examples, practical exercises, and detailed explanations about CSS theory and styling techniques.

2. **CSS Projects**:  
   In the **`project/`** folder, I developed two projects inspired by the examples shown in the **SergieCode** course, but with different approaches. One of them is a website about the band **Rammstein**, created as a practical application of CSS. The other is a conceptual project focused on core CSS topics, organized in tabs such as **borders**, **backgrounds**, and **styles**, designed to reinforce and demonstrate individual CSS features through interactive examples. Both projects were developed using the knowledge acquired throughout the course.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Use of Non-Owned Content  
In both parts of this repository (the course and the projects), **multimedia resources** (such as images, videos, audio, and icons) that are not my own work have been used. These resources belong to their respective creators and companies. They are used exclusively for educational purposes, within the context of the course and projects, and **are not for commercial use**. All copyright over the visual, audio, and video content belongs to the respective original creators.

### üîë Educational Purpose  
The main goal of this repository is to learn and practice CSS, as well as the use of styling techniques in web development. Any multimedia resources used in the projects are **purely educational** and **non-commercial**. Throughout the development of these projects, I have implemented **my own work**, such as detailed comments in the code, custom adjustments, and in-depth research to enrich and strengthen the learning process.

## üíº Project Structure  

### üìÇ Folders  
- **`course/`**: Contains all the notes and examples related to the basic and practical concepts of CSS that I learned in the **SergieCode** course.
  
- **`project/`**: Contains two projects developed as a practical application of the knowledge acquired during the course. One of them is focused on the band **Rammstein**, and the other is organized by **CSS concepts** such as borders, backgrounds, and styles. These projects are based on CSS and demonstrate the use of styling techniques through creative and structured examples.

üí° *This README outlines the structure and purpose of the repository to facilitate its understanding and maintenance. The course and projects are practical examples designed to learn and demonstrate the use of CSS.*

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important  
The **code** in this repository is **my own work**, as it was written and adapted by me during the course and project development. The only elements that do not belong to me are the multimedia resources (images, audio, videos, etc.), which have been used for educational purposes, always respecting the copyright of the original creators.

- The **course** includes examples and resources taken for educational purposes, respecting the copyright of the original creators.  
- The **CSS projects** were created with the same purpose: to practice what I learned in the **SergieCode** course. All multimedia resources used (images, audio, videos, etc.) are owned by their respective authors and companies and are used for educational purposes, respecting the copyright.

üíª *These projects and course were made for educational purposes, based on the **SergieCode** course, and with the goal of learning and practicing CSS.*

## üèÜ Acknowledgments and Mentions  
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to teacher `¬©SergieCode` for his invaluable contribution to my learning in the CSS course. Thanks to his clear explanations, practical approach, and generosity in sharing his knowledge, this project has become possible. His dedication and effort have been essential to expanding my horizons and taking my learning to a higher level. I deeply thank him for being such an inspiring and committed instructor.

I also want to extend my deepest recognition to the creators of the multimedia resources used in these projects. The **visual**, **audio**, and **video** content belongs to their respective authors and companies, and without their material, this project would not have been able to reach the quality and clarity it  present today. I am very grateful for the work and dedication they have put into creating these resources. I apologize for any inconvenience, and with the utmost respect, I thank them for allowing us to access them for educational purposes. I have made sure to select the highest-quality resources to honor their efforts and dedication.

## üó£Ô∏è Project Language  
All the content in this repository, both in the **projects** and the **course**, is in **Spanish**. I have chosen to keep the content in this language because it is a **personal** project, and it is easier for me to understand and organize the information in Spanish. This choice has allowed me to work more efficiently and in greater detail in the comments and code structure. **Only the repository description and this README will be in English**, to ensure that it is accessible to a wider audience, while maintaining a clear and understandable educational focus.
